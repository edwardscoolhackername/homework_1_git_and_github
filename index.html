<h2>About Kenny</h2>

<img src="D:/Work/kenny.jpg">

<p>Oh, hi there!<br>
Welcome to the "about Kenny" section of this page, where I share a bit about myself.<br>
I started out in St. Thomas, then moved to London when I was 8. Here are some facts about me:<br>
<ul>
	<li>I'm a cat person</li>
	<li>I prefer tea to coffee</li>
	<li>I have 8 tattoos, one is of Dwight Schrute</li>
	<li>The only plants I haven't killed are Devil's Ivy</li>
	<li>I can lick my elbow</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why I decided to take IDP at Fanshawe</h3>

<p>I've been self employed doing photography since I was sixteen. I love it with all my heart, but I felt like I needed a change.<br>
It's my dream to be able to create beautiful websites for entrepreneurs, like myself, at affordable price points.<br>
That's when I decided the IDP program was my best bet! And so far, I'm really enjoying it!
</p>

<p>In hopes of impressing Tina, I have included one of my favourite study songs below.<br>

		<ul>

			<li>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Studio Art from the University of Guelph.</li>
			<li>I listen to black and death metal to relax.</li>
			<li>I have to keep my hands moving to focus in lectures, so I am usually drawing fantasy characters while I listen.</li>

	<h3>Why I decided to take IDP at Fanshawe</h3>
	<p>I have taken a variety of art courses over my artistic career, and worked with many kinds of physical mediums. But the most exciting classes were the ones where I got to work with some basic HTML and CSS, and some digital 3D work. I enjoyed them so much, that I decided to make it my career, to blend my artistic pursuits with the unique possibilites of these technologies. </p>
