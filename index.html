	<p> Scholar. Poet. Self-proclaimed Gravy King of Strathroy. All these and more describe other people who have met Edward Willems. <br> For the first time, here is an exclusive in-depth look to get to know the <i>real</i> Edward. <br>
		<ul>
			<li>I'm a cat-person.</li>
			<li>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Studio Art from the University of Guelph.</li>
			<li>I listen to black and death metal to relax.</li>
			<li>I have to keep my hands moving to focus in lectures, so I am usually drawing fantasy characters while I listen.</li>
			<li>I cannot roll my "r"s.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Why I decided to take IDP at Fanshawe</h3>
	<p>I have taken a variety of art courses over my artistic career, and worked with many kinds of physical mediums. But the most exciting classes were the ones where I got to work with some basic HTML and CSS, and some digital 3D work. I enjoyed them so much, that I decided to make it my career, to blend my artistic pursuits with the unique possibilites of these technologies. </p>
