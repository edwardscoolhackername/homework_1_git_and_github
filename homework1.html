<h2>About Kenny</h2>

<p>Oh, hi there!<br>
Welcome to the "about Kenny" section of this page, where I share a bit about myself.<br>
I started out in St. Thomas, then moved to London when I was 8. Here are some facts about me:<br>
<ul>
	<li>I'm a cat person</li>
	<li>I prefer tea to coffee</li>
	<li>I have 8 tattoos, one is of Dwight Schrute</li>
	<li>The only plants I haven't killed are Devil's Ivy</li>
	<li>I can lick my elbow</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Why I decided to take IDP at Fanshawe</h3>

<p>I've been self employed doing photography since I was sixteen. I love it with all my heart, but I felt like I needed a change.<br>
It's my dream to be able to create beautiful websites for entrepreneurs, like myself, at affordable price points.<br>
That's when I decided the IDP program was my best bet! And so far, I'm really enjoying it!
</p>

<p>In hopes of impressing Tina, I have included one of my favourite study songs below.<br>
